# React Hooks

(Normal JS utility functions)

- useState() - Superpowerful State Variables in react
- useEffect()

# React Basics

- Two types of Export/Import

  - Default Export/Import

    1. export default Component;
    2. import Component from "path";

  - Named Export/Import

    1. export const Component;
    2. import {Component} from "path";

# Reconcilation Algorithum (React Fiber)

- https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture
- The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures.
- Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

# Doubts

- Do we have something on load of a component? useEffect works after the component is rendered.
